The Nerdidor is an Arduino based wireless temperature and humidity sensor for a humidor.

It is based on RFBee code.

Here are links to the hardware used:

The Bee Stem is basically a breakout for the RFBee. All code resides on the RFBee. I am currently using a Grove T&H sensor which fits nicely into the Bee Stem.
